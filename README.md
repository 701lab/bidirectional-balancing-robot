# bidirectional-balancing-robot

A bidirectional balancing robot is 4 wheels 2 axis robot that can drive like a 4 wheels car and balance on both axes independently. Also, it can climb a wall to get from 4 wheels into a balancing position. This is a BSUIR project and a lot of the stuff can be done poorly or unprofessionally. If you are interested some photos of the robot will be at the end of this README.

### How to use

This project is not intended for use outside of the balancing robot developed in BSUIR, so there will be no detailed instructions on how the code works. But there are instructions on how to run the code on the BSUIR developed robot.
